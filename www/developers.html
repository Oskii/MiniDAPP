Creating a MiniDAPP is simple.<br>
<br>
They are standalone HTML5 websites using HTML, JavaScript and CSS that communicate 
with the Minima application over simple JSON RPC calls.<br>
<br>
All the Minima logic to use the RPC is in a sinlge JS file.. <a href="./minidapps/minima.js" download>minima.js</a><br>
<br>
A MiniDAPP is the folder with your html app, a minidapp.conf file and a couple of images for the 'Menu'.. all zipped up and renamed *.minidapp. 
You can open and inspect any MiniDAPP by changing the extension to .zip and using any regular archive program or unzip directly from the command line.<br>
<br> 
This entire site, all the MiniDAPPs with their source code, and the latest minima.js file can be downloaded from github<br>
<br>
<b>git clone https://github.com/spartacusrex99/MiFi.git</b><br>
<br>
The Main MINIDAPP Hub is accessed as a website hosted directly in the Minima application..<br>
<br>
Use <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:21000/">http://127.0.0.1:21000/</a> if you are running the java application locally or use the Phones' IP instead of 127.0.0.1 to browse from your desktop.<br>
<br>
( SSL support coming.. everything still very much in BETA )<br>
<Br>
The SIMPLEST app to get started is <b>Block-X</b>. A super simple block explorer that shows how to create a minidapp and conect to the minima network. Start from there..<br>
<br> 
The most USEFUL mindapps are TERMINAL and SCRIPT IDE. I use both constantly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a breakdown of the Block-X app<br>
