Creating a MiniDAPP is simple.<br>
<br>
They are standalone HTML5 sites, that run in full from any folder - not a website, using normal HTML, JavaScript and CSS and communicate 
with the Minima application over simple JSON RPC calls.<br>
<br>
All the Minima logic to use the RPC is in a sinlge JS file.. minima.js.<br>
<br>
A MiniDAPP is the folder with your html app, a minidapp.conf file and a couple of images for the 'Menu'.. all zipped up and renamed *.minidapp. 
You can open and inspect any MiniDAPP by using any regular archive program or unzip directly from the command line.<br>
<br>
The MiFi demo shows how to integrate Minima into a normal website. The code is exactly the same as a MiniDAPP - and all you need to do is log 
into the Minima Pop Up that appears. Obviously - Users must be running Minima. We don't want another MetaMask on our hands..<br> 
<br>
The only change between using the MiniDAPP and MiFi minima.js file is MINIMA_IS_MINIDAPP variable. This stops the Minima 
PopUp from appearing.. and minima.js is served and editted automatically from the Minima app when using the MiniDAPP Hub.<br> 
<br>
The minima.js lib also come with the Decimal JS class for high precision mathematics built in - a MUST when using numbers in Minima as JavaScript default number handling is frankly embarrassing. Also a QR Code generator lib. Check the demos to see usage or look at the full versions in the js folder.<br>
<br>
This entire site with all the MiniDAPPs can be downloaded from github<br>
<br>
<b>git clone https://github.com/spartacusrex99/MiFi.git</b><br>
<br>
The main Minima application can be downloaded from<br>
<br>
<b>git clone https://github.com/spartacusrex99/Minima.git</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The Main MINIDAPP Hub is accessed as a website hosted directly in the Minima application..<br>
<br>
Use <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:21000/">http://127.0.0.1:21000/</a> if you are running the java locally or use the Phones' IP instead to browse from your desktop.<br>
<br>
( SSL support coming.. everything still very much pre-ALPHA )<br>
<br>
Running a private testnet is very simple.<br>
<br>
<b>java -jar minima.jar -private</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The SIMPLEST dapp is <b>Block-X</b>. Start from there..<br>
<br> 
The MiFi demos take you through a time-lock contract and basic wallet.<br>
<br> 
The next dapp to chew on is <b>FUTURE CASH</b>. Shows how to create a complete MiniDAPP.<br>
<br> 
The most USEFUL dapps are <b>TERMINAL</b> and <b>SCRIPT IDE</b>. I use both constantly.<br>
<br>
The most COMPLICATED Minima back-end "so far" is the <a href="./minidapps/coinflip/js/miniscript.txt">COIN FLIP</a> script..<br>
<br>
The most FINANCIAL dapp is <b>DEXXED</b>.. an old classic. ( simple scripts tricky front-end )<br>
<br>
The Main Minima Wallet is written in IONIC.. full source on <a href="https://github.com/eliasnemr/Minima">github</a><br>
