<h3>Multi Sig Wallet</h3>
<br>


Ok .. You have funds and you want 2 people to sign a transaction to be able to spend them.<br>
<br>
This works best if you have 2 people playing.. so get someone to open this page on their computer on their separate version of Minima.<br>
<br>

<div style='width:900;text-align:left;'>

Step 1 : You need to make you Keys.<br>
<Br>
Step 2 : Ask your friend for their PUBLIC KEY.. and paste it here. We'll create an address with 1 Minima that can only be spent if BOTH sign.<br>
<Br>
Step 4 : Now create the transaction that tries to spend those funds.. <br>
<br>

</div>
