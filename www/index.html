MiFi - stands for Minima Finance. Decentralisd Finance Minima Style.<br>
<br>
When you integrate Minima into your website or business this is known as <b>MiFi</b>..<br>
<br>
You may want to take payment in Minima or some token that runs on Minima.
You may want to track and trace goods, manage vouchers that are specific to your website or
even share your custom game tokens.. This type of integration is centralised around your application of it, but takes
advantage of the power an open permissionless blockchain system like Minima affords.<br>
<br>
When you integrate the outside world into Minima you create a <b>MiniDAPP</b>..<br>
<br>
A MiniDAPP is a standalone application that runs on the Minima network. MiniDAPPs can be unstoppable,
uncensorable, resilient, decentralised applications that do not rely on anyone or anything other than
a functioning Minima network. TRUE DEFI.<br>
<br>
Anyone can create and distribute a MiniDAPP.<br>

"..if I have to go to your website to use your DAPP - it's not a DAPP" - Spartacus Rex
