MiFi - stands for Minima Finance. Decentralisd Finance Minima Style.<br>
<br>
When you integrate Minima into your website or business this is known as <b>MiFi</b>..<br>
<br>
You may want to take payment in Minima or some token that runs on Minima.
You may want to track and trace goods, manage vouchers that are specific to your website, share custom game 
tokens or require some other completely original smart contract functionality. This type of integration is centralised 
around your application of it, but takes advantage of the power an open permissionless blockchain system like Minima affords.<br>
<br>
When you integrate the outside world into Minima you create a <b>MiniDAPP</b>..<br>
<br>
A MiniDAPP is a standalone application that runs on the Minima network. MiniDAPPs can be unstoppable,
uncensorable, resilient, decentralised applications that do not rely on anyone or anything other than
a functioning Minima network. TRUE D.E.F.I.<br>
<br>
Anyone can create and distribute a MiniDAPP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>What is a Smart Contract ?</b><br>
<br>
Smart Contracts are programs that run on Minima.<br>
<br>
They automatically manage money, tokens and value.<br>
<br>
They can be hard to interact with directly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>What is a DAPP ?</b><br>
<br>
DAPPs are Decentralised Applications.<br>
<br>
They are front-ends to Smart Contracts.<br>
<br>
They make interacting with Smart Contracts easy.<br>
<br>
<br>
To be considered a <b>TRUE</b> DAPP..
<br>
<br>
1) No one can stop you using it<br>
<br>
2) No one can censor who you use it with<br>
<br>
3) No one can force a change to it<br>
<br>
4) No one can turn it off<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>MINIDAPPS</b> allow for this type of DAPP and more..<br>
